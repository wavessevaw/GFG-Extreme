# MAKO third-party notices

This document supplements [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). It identifies third-party material distributed with MAKO and proprietary software that MAKO can use but does not distribute. Each third-party copyright, license, and trademark remains with its owner.

## Lossless Scaling is not distributed by MAKO

MAKO is an independent open-source project. MAKO source archives, MAKO Renderer packages, GFG Extreme packages, Flatpak extensions, and the MAKO website do not contain or distribute Lossless Scaling, `Lossless.dll`, or extracted LS1 or LSFG model and shader payloads.

The open MAKO Scaler works without Lossless Scaling. A user who chooses LSFG frame generation or LS1 scaling must independently obtain a lawful copy of Lossless Scaling and select or permit discovery of its locally installed `Lossless.dll`. The user is responsible for complying with the terms and law applicable to that copy. MAKO grants no license or other rights in Lossless Scaling or its proprietary resources.

When a licensed model is selected, MAKO Renderer reads the user-supplied local DLL at runtime and uses the resources needed for the selected LSFG or LS1 feature. MAKO does not install, upload, package, or alter the DLL, or save extracted resources as standalone files.

Lossless Scaling, LS1, and LSFG are used descriptively and remain the property of their respective owner. MAKO is not affiliated with or endorsed by Lossless Scaling.

## Incorporated Renderer and Decky source

The complete notices for the original Decky LSFG-VK plugin, the GPL-3.0-or-later lsfg-vk version 2 Renderer lineage, toml++, Bjoern Hoehrmann's UTF-8 decoder, and Steam Deck Homebrew components are reproduced in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

### lsfg-vk Renderer provenance

MAKO Renderer descends directly from PancakeTAS's GPL-3.0-or-later lsfg-vk version 2 tree at upstream commit [`8b0da2661c6f3473a7fccc8ba643880050e71642`](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/commit/8b0da2661c6f3473a7fccc8ba643880050e71642). MAKO's experimental predecessor carried that baseline to `v2.0.0-dev28-experimental.25` at [`276030d4925c40038a61ecd66bd49ce777faec8c`](https://github.com/eugeniosegala/lsfg-vk-experimental/commit/276030d4925c40038a61ecd66bd49ce777faec8c), and that Renderer lineage entered this monorepo in [`8ed1cdbe7f5496fade8ad01d85ac3d671957fcac`](https://github.com/eugeniosegala/MAKO/commit/8ed1cdbe7f5496fade8ad01d85ac3d671957fcac).

Copyright in the incorporated portions remains with the respective lsfg-vk copyright holders. The incorporated source files identify themselves as `GPL-3.0-or-later`, and MAKO remains distributed under that license. The MIT License used for lsfg-vk version 1 does not describe MAKO Renderer's version 2 lineage.

## Gamescope surface protocol

MAKO Renderer's optional scaling surface adapter declares the association/destruction requests and version-one events from Valve's [Gamescope swapchain protocol at commit `2d217a16c7e5b56c7417257279bf102320cff024`](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/blob/2d217a16c7e5b56c7417257279bf102320cff024/protocol/gamescope-swapchain.xml). This protocol material carries the following MIT notice:

## Bundled vkBasalt Vulkan layer

MAKO Renderer native archives and Flatpak extensions include 64-bit and 32-bit vkBasalt libraries from [MAKO's maintained fork](https://github.com/eugeniosegala/vkBasalt), based on [upstream vkBasalt](https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt). [`engine/vkbasalt-release.json`](engine/vkbasalt-release.json) records the current release tag, source and upstream commits, immutable asset URL, and checksum used by packaging.

vkBasalt is copyright © 2019–2022 Georg Lehmann and is distributed under the zlib License. Its bundled ReShade shader headers are copyright © 2014 Patrick Mours and distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License. MAKO packages the complete notices as `share/doc/mako-render/vkbasalt/LICENSE` and `share/doc/mako-render/vkbasalt/RESHade-LICENSE.md`, plus exact source provenance and the MAKO pin. Those files remain part of every archive and runtime extension containing vkBasalt.

## Bundled vkBasalt shader presets

The upstream MAKO Renderer lineage used by GFG Extreme includes `Vibrance.fx`, `Curves.fx`, `Technicolor.fx`, `Sepia.fx`, `Monochrome.fx`, `Vignette.fx`, `FakeHDR.fx`, `Technicolor2.fx`, `DPX.fx`, `FilmGrain.fx`, `Cartoon.fx`, `Nostalgia.fx`, and `ChromaticAberration.fx` derived from [CeeJayDK/SweetFX commit `407c11562950195c1b45461fbb59f4bd6bbe7ba4`](https://github.com/CeeJayDK/SweetFX/commit/407c11562950195c1b45461fbb59f4bd6bbe7ba4) and distributed under that repository's MIT License. Upstream author credits remain in the source files. MAKO replaces the shaders' `ReShadeUI.fxh` UI macros with equivalent explicit annotations; their algorithms and defaults are otherwise unchanged.

`Colourfulness.fx` is copied from [crosire/reshade-shaders commit `4fee10cdac28f0a6d4fa5ddd778faf0016ab7b91`](https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/commit/4fee10cdac28f0a6d4fa5ddd778faf0016ab7b91). It is copyright © 2016–2018 bacondither and is redistributed under the permissive BSD-style terms preserved in its header and in `LICENSE-Colourfulness`. MAKO changes only the optional `ReShadeUI.fxh` UI annotation macro. `BleachBypass.fx` and `Noir.fx` are original MAKO GPL-3.0-or-later shaders.

MAKO also includes `ReShade.fxh` from [crosire/reshade-shaders `slim` commit `6db142b4b1a05c764222e5b0bd9a644b7ccfe1dc`](https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/commit/6db142b4b1a05c764222e5b0bd9a644b7ccfe1dc), which declares [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode). MAKO's Clarity and Levels Plus are original GPL-3.0-or-later effects with comparable purposes to third-party effects, not redistributed copies. Exact provenance and complete SweetFX and Colourfulness license texts are kept with the canonical sources under `plugin/py_modules/gfg_plugin/vkbasalt_shaders/` and installed with MAKO Renderer under `share/mako-render/vkbasalt-shaders/`.

## GFG Extreme frontend

GFG Extreme's compiled frontend includes the following third-party code and icon data. Declared dependencies are in `plugin/package.json`, and exact resolutions are in `plugin/pnpm-lock.yaml`. GFG Extreme packages include the upstream license files under `third_party_licenses/` and a frontend source map with the bundled dependency source content.
